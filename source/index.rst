Welcome to Open Culture
=======================

What is Open Culture
--------------------

''Open Culture'' is a concept according to which knowledge should be spread freely and its growth should come from developing, altering or enriching already existing works on the basis of sharing and collaboration, without being restricted by rules linked to the legal protection of intellectual property. In the context of globalization, the consequence is that all citizens should have equal access to information.

Why Open Culture
----------------

Open Culture enables people to work together to create innovative solutions to problems.
Open Culture can attribute to GPS, medicine, software, most of the internet, and so much more.
Open Culture practices these core values:

Collaboration
   Open Culture projects allow many people to work towards a goal,
   even people who are not connected to a particular company or organization.
Innovation
   Open Culture projects create the future. Society would not be where it is today
   if Open Culture hasn't invented things like the internet.
Transparency
   Open Culture is open, the goal is to not give full control of the project to a small group of people
   but allow others to see and participate in the development of the project.
Community
   Open Culture projects go beyond just the project and create avenues for like minded people to fellowship with each other.
