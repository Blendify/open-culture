Welcome to Open Culture's documentation!
========================================

What is Open Culture
--------------------

''Open Culture'' is a concept according to which knowledge should be spread freely and its growth should come from developing, altering or enriching already existing works on the basis of sharing and collaboration, without being restricted by rules linked to the legal protection of intellectual property. In a context of globalization, the consequence is that all citizens should have equal access to information.


Types
=====

Computing
---------

Without doubt, computer technology is the field where Open Source Culture is the most widespread. The phrase "open source" refers to a wide range of software licenses whose source code is made available to the public without any or with few copyright restrictions. Anyone can use, study, or modify the software at will, so long as the same rights are given to subsequent users.

Open architecture
-----------------

This is a type of software that allows adding, upgrading and modifying blueprint components. Potential users may browse inside all or parts of the plans without any proprietary constraints. This is especially useful in developing countries, where model houses could adapted to local climate, environment, social culture, etc.

Open design
-----------

Application of open source methods to the creation of physical products, machines and systems either to foster projects where funding or commercial interest is lacking, for instance in developing countries, or for the realization of projects too ambitious for the resources of one company or country.

Open music
----------

Music available in "source code" form allowing composers the use of already existing works, either to remix them or to create new works, while possibly inviting public participation.

Open cinema
-----------

As in the case of Open music, this is possibility for film - or video makers to use already existing works in order to create new works, while possibly inviting public participation.

Open Science
------------

The ideals of Open Source Culture are also found in the world of the sciences, for instance in the field of medecine and pharmaceuticals. There have been several proposals for open-source pharmaceutical development, which have led to the establishment of the Tropical Disease Initiative, aiming at fighting diseases widespread in developing countries.
