What is Open Science
====================

Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software)
and its dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society, amateur or professional.
Open science is transparent and accessible knowledge that is shared and developed through collaborative networks.
It encompasses practices such as publishing open research, campaigning for open access,
encouraging scientists to practice open notebook science, and generally making it easier
to publish and communicate scientific knowledge.
