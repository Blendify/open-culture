What is Open Source
===================

Open Source is one of the biggest parts to Open Culture.
While a lot of different projects might call themselves "Open Source"
the official definition is the software's original source code
is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.

Open Source software is used, at somepoint up the ladder,
to make virtually everything people use today. It is the backbone of the internet,
and most other software has to use components of Open Source to function.
